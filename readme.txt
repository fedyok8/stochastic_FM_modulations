Space-time analysis of stochastic structures
Frequency modulation of signals:

1. fmconst — Signal with constant frequency modulation,
2. fmhyp — Signal with hyperbolic frequency modulation,
3. fmlin — Signal with linear frequency modulation,
4. fmodany — Signal with arbitrary frequency modulation,
5. fmpar — Parabolic frequency modulated signal,
6. fmpower — Signal with power-law frequency modulation,
7. fmsin — Signal with sinusoidal frequency modulation,
8. gdpower — Signal with power-law group delay.
